Create a landing page for a fictional travel agency that promotes destinations and services. The page should include:
1. HTML Structure
A header with the agency name and navigation bar (Home, Destinations, Packages, Contact).
A hero section with a background image and tagline (e.g., “Explore the World With Us”).
A destinations section with 3–4 featured places, each displayed in a card with an image, title, and short description.
A packages section with pricing tables (e.g., Basic, Premium, Luxury).
A footer with contact info and social media links.
2. CSS Styling
Use a vibrant color palette (e.g., sky blue, white, and accent colors like orange or green).
Style the navigation bar with hover effects.
Add shadows and rounded corners to destination cards.
Style pricing tables with borders, spacing, and highlighted “best value” package.
3. CSS Animations
Animate the hero tagline to fade in and zoom slightly on page load.
Animate destination cards to lift when hovered.
Add a smooth hover transition effect to pricing tables (e.g., highlight border color).
4. Tailwind CSS
Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, colors, and typography.
Make the destination cards responsive (grid layout on desktop, stacked on mobile).
Add a Tailwind-styled “Book Now” button under each package.
